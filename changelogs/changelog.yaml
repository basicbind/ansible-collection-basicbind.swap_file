      bugfixes:
        - 'swap_file - Fixed bug where a new swap file could replace
                       an old one and swapon would fail. For instance,
                       if the user tried fallocate on a filesystem where
                       the newly created swap file would not be seen as
                       a useable swap file. swapon is now attempted on
                       the new swap file before replacing the old one.'
